# Bell_inequalities
In this repository I upgrade the code for calculate the violation in Bell inequalities. 
25.02.2022 - in 2022_02_25_Bell_inequalities_nmd_cv.nb there is the source code with the result of the table 1 of the paper ''Avenues to generalising Bell inequalities'' https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06606.pdf 
We are working for new results for new Bell inequalities! A future task would be the generalization where each player has different resources.
