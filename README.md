# Bell_inequalities
In this repository is the code for calculating the violation in Bell inequalities and the picture generated by Wolfram Mathematica.

1. 2022_02_25_Bell_inequalities_nmd_cv.nb There is the source code with the result of table 1 of the paper M. Karczewski, G. Scala, A. Mandarino, A. B. Sainz, M. Zukowski, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 384011, ''Avenues to generalising Bell inequalities'', 2022, https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac8a28

2. CHSHpolytope.nb there is the animated gift of the CHSH sub polytope in Nicol√°s Gigena, Giovanni Scala, and Antonio Mandarino, Revisited aspects of the local set in CHSH Bell scenario, International Journal of Quantum Information, 21, 07, 2340005 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219749923400051.

3.  In CHSH stable is Pennylane code to compute CHSH on an optimal error mitigation strategy

We are working for new results for new Bell inequalities! A future task would be the generalization where each player has different resources.
