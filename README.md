# Bell_inequalities
In this repository there are the code for calculate the violation in Bell inequalities and the picture generated by Wolfram Mathematica. 

Description of the file in this folder:

2022_02_25_Bell_inequalities_nmd_cv.nb there is the source code with the result of the table 1 of the paper M. Karczewski, G. Scala, A. Mandarino, A. B. Sainz, M. Zukowski, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 384011, ''Avenues to generalising Bell inequalities'', 2022, https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac8a28

CHSHpolytope.nb there is the animated gifted of the CHSH subpolytope.

We are working for new results for new Bell inequalities! A future task would be the generalization where each player has different resources.
